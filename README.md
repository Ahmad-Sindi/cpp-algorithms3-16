# Algorithm Challenge #16 – Check Sparse Matrix (Level 3)

🧮 **Problem Description**
-
This program checks whether a 3×3 matrix is a **Sparse Matrix**.

A matrix is considered *sparse* when the number of zero elements is **greater than or equal to half** of the total number of elements.

For a 3×3 matrix:
- Total elements = 9
- Half = 9 / 2 = 4 (integer division)

If the matrix contains **4 or more zeros**, it is classified as sparse.

🧩 **Example**
-
**Matrix Input:**

0 0 1 
5 4 6 
0 0 9 

**Analysis:**
- Number of zeros = 4
- Matrix size = 9
- 9 / 2 = 4

**Output:**
Yes: it is a sparse matrix.
